# SQL Editor using React

The site is hosted on: [https://sql-editor-ishita.netlify.app/](https://sql-editor-ishita.netlify.app/) âœ¨

This web app is front-end of an SQL editor which can be used to execute the SQL queries.
It consists of an Editor and a Terminal. Some predefined queries that can be executed are provided in the buttons.
#### The website is responsive.


There are 2 buttons : 
- Run button : It executes the query.
- Save button : It prints the webpage.

This is how the website looks:

### Page Load Time :

The page load time as calculated by tools.pingdom.com was 499ms. I did not use png files and rather switched to svgs to reduce the page load time.
I refactored the code to reduce the file size. Decreasing the files' sizes also makes it easier to combine them. The result is cleaner code, and leaner web pages that load faster.
